# Huberman Health AI Assistant 🎧🧠

A **Streamlit-based semantic search application** that allows users to find relevant videos and specific timestamps from the **Huberman Lab Podcast** transcripts.  
The app uses **Google's Generative AI Embeddings** and **ChromaDB** for efficient and accurate search.

---

## ✨ Features

- 🔍 **Semantic Search**: Search for content using natural language queries (e.g., *"how to improve sleep hygiene"* or *"benefits of cold exposure"*).  
- 🎥 **Video & Timestamp Retrieval**: Returns the most relevant videos with **clickable timestamps** linking directly to the exact YouTube moment.  
- 💾 **Persistent Vector Store**: Uses **ChromaDB** for local storage — embeddings are created once and reused.  
- 🖥️ **Intuitive UI**: Clean and simple **Streamlit** interface for smooth user experience.
